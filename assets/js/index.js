                            resume</a>, you might've noticed that I graduated from Washington
                            University in St.
                            Louis with a Mechanical Engineering degree. How did I end up as a software engineer? During
                            my senior
                            year of college I took a web development course and loved it. It brought me back to the
                            middle school
                            days of Freewebs (and other self-hosted sites) where I spent hours dabbling with HTML and
                            CSS!
                            Having learned modern, up-to-date web practices, I became very interested in web dev as a
                            possible
                            career. After graduation, I taught myself how to code in JavaScript and was
                            fortunate
                            enough to find a web
                            development job in my hometown, Dallas.

                                    Quickly learned Python and AWS tools to update 30+ files within the existing data engine pipeline. Removed and replaced hard-coded strings with variables to extend the codeâ€™s usage across multiple AWS S3 buckets. Learned to test and automatically run the processes using Airflow.

                                    Built a new pipeline using Python for loading data into AWS Redshift tables. Simplified the original process by requiring one customizable configuration file that contains all necessary table information. The configuration file served as a framework for loading a variety of data into the same table. Reduced overall load time by 78%.
